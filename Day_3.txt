Task Description : Disabling direct SSH root login

Disabling direct SSH root login is a basic but very important security step on any Linux machine.
Disabling direct SSH root login makes your Linux machine much harder to hack, easier to audit, and safer to use.
It forces people to log in normally first, which is a much more secure way to manage a server.

1.	Root has full power
	The root account can do anything on the system — delete files, change settings, access all data.
	If someone gets the root password, they instantly control the whole machine.
	
2. Hackers often target the root user
	Attackers know the username “root” exists on every Linux system.
	That means they only need to guess the password.
	By disabling root login, you remove an easy, common target.
	
3. Better to log in as a normal user first
	A safer practice is:
	Log in with a regular user
	Use sudo to run admin commands
	This gives better tracking, because you can see who did what, instead of everything showing as “root”.
	
4.  Protects the system from mistakes
	When logged in directly as root, a simple typo can break the system.
	Using sudo reduces accidental damage.
	
	
Task Procedure step by step :

Step 1: Edit the SSH daemon configuration file
	 	Open the SSH config file with your preferred editor:
		sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Step 2: Find and modify the PermitRootLogin directive
		Locate the line:
		#PermitRootLogin yes
		Change it to:
		PermitRootLogin no
		If the line is missing, add it manually.

Step 3: (Optional) Ensure password authentication isn't enabling root login indirectly
You may also want to disable password authentication:
PasswordAuthentication no
(Only do this if you have SSH keys set up, or you’ll lock yourself out.)

Step 4: Restart the SSH service
		Apply the changes:
		sudo systemctl restart sshd
		Some distros use:
		sudo systemctl restart ssh
		
Step 5: Verify
		Try logging in as root; it should now fail:
		ssh root@your_server_ip
