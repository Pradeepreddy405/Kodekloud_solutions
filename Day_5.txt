What is SELinux ?
SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a Linux kernel security module that provides mandatory access control (MAC). 
It enforces strict rules on how processes, users, and files interact, reducing the impact of misconfigurations or compromised applications.


In Simple way : 

SELinux adds an extra security layer by defining:

What actions a process can perform
Which files a process can access
Which network ports/services it can interact with
It uses policies to enforce this. Even root is restricted.

Example:
Apache web server normally reads website files.
Without SELinux, if Apache is hacked, it could read other files on your server.
With SELinux, Apache cannot read anything outside its allowed folder.

Policies : define what is allowed. 

Major types are:
Targeted – only selected services are restricted (most common)
Strict   – everything is confined
MLS      – multi-level security (used for high-security environments)

Modes:

1:Enforcing – SELinux rules are enforced
2:Permissive – Violations are logged but not blocked
3:Disabled – SELinux is turned off


SELinux is widely used in production environments where security is critical

1. Enterprise Linux servers : RHEL, CentOS, AlmaLinux, and Fedora ship with SELinux enabled by default.

2. Web hosting : Prevents compromised services (e.g., Apache, Nginx) from accessing sensitive files.

3. Databases   : SELinux restricts MySQL/PostgreSQL to specific directories and ports.

4. Container platforms
	Podman uses SELinux labels for container isolation
	OpenShift (Red Hat's Kubernetes) relies heavily on SELinux to isolate pods
5. Security-critical environments : 
	Government, finance, healthcare, and telecommunication systems.
	
Without SELinux :

       │   Apache   │
       └─────┬──────┘
             │
             ▼
    ┌────────────────────┐
    │ Entire File System │
    └────────────────────┘

With SELinux : 

       │   Apache   │
       └─────┬──────┘
             │  SELinux Policy Says:
             │  "Apache can only read web files"
             ▼
       ┌──────────────┐
       │ Allowed Zone │
       └──────────────┘

       ┌──────────────┐
       │ Blocked Zone │  ← Apache cannot enter
       └──────────────┘	
	   
What Happens When Something is Blocked?

Program tries action
       │
       ▼
 SELinux checks policy
       │
 ┌─────┴───────┐
 │ Allowed?     │
 ├──────────────┤
 │ YES → Action continues
 │ NO  → Block + Log
 └──────────────┘
 

One more example to understand about SELinux :

 
	/var/www/html  → label: httpd_sys_content_t      (Apache area)
	/var/lib/mysql → label: mysqld_db_t              (MySQL area)
	/home/user     → label: user_home_t              (Your personal area)
	
	
	Apache guest enters → Security Guard  
	Shows badge (httpd_t)  
	Guard checks room label (httpd_sys_content_t)
	If badge matches the allowed room → let in 🚪
	If badge does NOT match → BLOCK ❌
	
	


Task Description :  SElinux Installation and Configuration

	
Step 1:	Check if SELinux tools exist	
		command : rpm -qa | grep selinux
		
Step 2:	Install SELinux by below command
		sudo dnf install -y selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted policycoreutils policycoreutils-python-utils
Step 3: Check the config file 
		command: /etc/selinux/config

Step 4: sestatus   ---It will tells about SELinux is in 
		Output : SELinux status:                 disabled  
Step 5: sudo vi /etc/selinux/config    ---Edit config file and set it according to the task
