Objective : Create a temporary user account on Linux that:

	    Has an expiry date/time

	    (Optionally) has limited permissions or access scope

	    Can be automatically removed or disabled after expiry


Step-by-Step: Create a Temporary User with Expiry

Step 1: Check prerequisites

You’ll need root or sudo privileges.

sudo su -


Step 2: Create the user
Use the useradd command with the -e (expiry) flag.
Syntax:sudo useradd -e YYYY-MM-DD username

Example:sudo useradd -m -e 2025-11-15 tempuser
This creates a user tempuser that expires on Nov 15, 2025.
The -m flag creates a home directory (/home/tempuser).

 
Step 3: Set password
sudo passwd tempuser
The user can now log in until the expiry date.

Step 4: Verify expiry date
sudo chage -l tempuser

You’ll see something like:

Account expires : Nov 15, 2025
Password expires : never
Last password change : today



Task Usage in real world scenarios : 

1.Temporary Access for Contractors or Interns
	When a third-party consultant, contractor, or intern needs system access for a short period:
	You can create a user that automatically expires when their contract ends.
	This avoids leaving orphaned accounts that could become security risks later.

2.Testing or Development Accounts
	Developers or QA testers often need temporary logins to test specific configurations or applications.
	Prevents test accounts from lingering indefinitely.
	Keeps system user lists clean and organized.
3. Training or Lab Environments
	In a training setup or classroom environment:
	Each student gets a temporary account valid for the session duration.
	After the course or exam, accounts automatically expire.
4. Automation and Cleanup
	In automated environments (like CI/CD servers or cloud instances):
	Temporary users can be created by scripts for tasks or testing.
	Expiry ensures they’re removed without manual intervention.
