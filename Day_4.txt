File permissions are one of the core concepts in Linux security


1.What File Permissions Are
		
		In Linux, every file and directory has permissions that determine:
		
		Who can access it
		What they can do with it
		
		There are three categories of users:
		Owner (u) → the person who created the file
		Group (g) → users in the same group as the owner
		Others (o) → everyone else
		
2. The Three Permission Types
		Each user category can have three kinds of permissions:
		
		Symbol	Name	Meaning for a File	Meaning for a Directory
		r		Read	Can view file contents	Can list directory contents
		w		Write	Can modify the file	Can create/delete inside dir
		x		Execute	Can run the file as a program	Can enter (cd) the directory
		
3. Viewing Permissions
		Use the command:
		ls -l
		
		
		Example output:
		- rwx r-x r--  1 Infra_team Infra_team  4096 Nov 13 09:00 script.sh
		
		
		Let’s break that down:
		
		- rwx r-x r--  1 Infra_team Infra_team  4096 Nov 13 09:00 script.sh
		| |   |   |
		| |   |   └── others
		| |   └────── group
		| └────────── owner
		└──────────── file type (- for file, d for directory)
		
		
		So:
		
		Owner: rwx → read, write, execute
		Group: r-x → read, execute
		Others: r-- → read only
		
4.Changing Permissions (chmod)
		Using Symbolic Mode
		
		Example:
		chmod u+x file.sh   # give execute permission to owner
		chmod g-w file.txt  # remove write permission from group
		chmod o=r file.txt  # others can only read
		
		Using Numeric (Octal) Mode
		Each permission type has a number:
		Permission	Value
		r	4
		w	2
		x	1
		
		Add them up for each group:
		Example	Meaning
		7 = 4+2+1 = rwx	
		6 = 4+2 = rw-	
		5 = 4+1 = r-x	
		4 = 4 = r--	
		
		So:
		chmod 755 script.sh
		
		means:
		Owner: 7 (rwx)
		Group: 5 (r-x)
		Others: 5 (r-x)
		
5.Changing Ownership
		Each file also has an owner and group.
		View it:
		ls -l
		
		
		Example:
		-rw-r--r-- 1 Devops_Guy Infra_team file.txt
		Here, Devops_Guy is the owner and Infra_team is the group.
		
		Change them:
		
		sudo chown <Owner_name> <file_name> or <folder_name>
		sudo chown Linux_Guy file.txt      		# change owner
		sudo chown :admins file.txt   			# change group
		sudo chown Linux_Guy:admins file.txt  	# change both



Task Description : Task Description : Granting Executable Permissions to a Script

Giving a script executable permissions is essential when you want users—or all users—to be able to run it. In Linux, even if a file exists and contains valid commands, it cannot be executed until the correct permissions are applied. This task ensures that the /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script can be executed by anyone on the system.

Why this is Important
1. Execution requires permission

Linux does not automatically allow files to run.
A script must have the executable bit set (x) before it can be executed.

2. Allows controlled access

Granting executable permissions ensures the script can be run by the intended users.
In this task, all users must be able to execute it, so permissions must be broad enough.

3. Best for shared environments

If multiple users or teams need to run the same script, granting execute rights makes collaboration smoother.
It prevents errors like:

permission denied: ./xfusioncorp.sh

4. Does not give edit or delete access

Giving everyone execute permissions does not allow them to modify the script.
This keeps the script safe while still accessible.


Step 1 : Verify the file exists
ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

If it exists but lacks execute permission, the output will look like:
Output : -rw-r--r-- 1 root root ... /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

Step 3: Grant execute permissions to all users
Use the chmod command to give owner, group, and others execute (x) permissions:

sudo chmod a+x /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
Here:

-> a = all users
-> +x = add execute permission


Step 4 : Verify the permission of a file
ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
Output : -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root ... /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

Step 5: Test the script
Any user should now be able to run the script using:
/tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
