Day 1: Linux User Setup with Non-Interactive Shell

Description : To create a user named "Devops_guy"with a non-interactive shell (so the user cannot log in interactively) on a Linux system.
you can use the useradd command and set the shell to /usr/sbin/nologin (or) /bin/false depending on your distro). 

Why ?

This task is needed mainly for security and system management purposes:

1: Prevent interactive login:
	Sometimes you need a user account for running background services, scripts, or daemons, not for someone to log in.
	Setting a non-interactive shell ensures the account cannot be used to access the system directly.

2: Limit security risks:
	Accounts that don’t need login access but exist for system processes could be exploited if they had normal shells.
	Using /usr/sbin/nologin or /bin/false reduces the attack surface.

3: Organizational or administrative purposes:
	Some system users (like www-data, mysql, or custom service users) are created this way to own files, run processes, or manage permissions without being interactive accounts.

In short: it’s about creating an account for system use without giving interactive login privileges, keeping the system safer and cleaner.
	
	
A real-world usecase

Example 1: Running a Web Server
Scenario - 1 : You install Apache or Nginx on a Linux server.
Requirement: The web server needs a user to own and run its processes, but you don’t want anyone logging in as that user.

Solution:
The system creates a user like www-data (Debian/Ubuntu) or apache (RHEL/CentOS).
This user has a non-interactive shell (/usr/sbin/nologin).

Benefits:
The web server can read/write its files safely under its own user.
No human can log in as www-data, preventing potential misuse if credentials were compromised.

Scenario - 2 :
Database services like MySQL or PostgreSQL create mysql/postgres users for running the database process. These users are non-login accounts, just like Devops_Guy in your task.
So the task is essentially about creating a safe system-only account.	
	
	
	
	Step 1:
	Open the terminal
	You need a terminal with root privileges because creating users requires admin rights.
	
	Step 2: 
	Choose a non-interactive shell
	A non-interactive shell means the user cannot log in interactively (cannot open a normal shell session).
	Common options:
	/usr/sbin/nologin  → Prevents login and shows a message like “This account is not available.”
	/bin/false         → Prevents login silently (no message).
	We’ll use /usr/sbin/nologin here.
	
	Step 3: 
	Create the user
	Use the useradd command:
	sudo useradd -s /usr/sbin/nologin Devops_Guy
	
	
	Explanation:
	sudo 					→ run the command as root
	useradd 				→ command to create a new user
	-s /usr/sbin/nologin 	→ sets the shell for the user
	Devops_Guy 				→ the username
	
	Step 4: 
	Set a password (optional)
	If you want to set a password (even if the user cannot log in):
	sudo passwd Devops_Guy
	It will ask you to enter and confirm the password.
	
	Note: Even with a password, the user still cannot log in interactively because the shell is non-interactive.
	
	Step 5: 
	Verify the user
	
	Check the user entry in /etc/passwd:
	grep Devops_Guy /etc/passwd
	You should see something like:
	Devops_Guy:x:1001:1001::/home/Devops_Guy:/usr/sbin/nologin
	
	
	Last part /usr/sbin/nologin confirms the user cannot log in interactively.
	 
	 
	 
One-liner command that creates the user Devops_Guy with a home directory, sets a password, and assigns a non-interactive shell:	
	command: sudo useradd -m -s /usr/sbin/nologin Devops_Guy && echo "Devops_Guy:YourPasswordHere" | sudo chpasswd
	
	
	Step-by-step explanation :

sudo useradd	  		→ Run as root to create a user.
-m 						→ Create a home directory /home/Devops_Guy.
-s /usr/sbin/nologin 	→ Assign a non-interactive shell.
Devops_Guy 				→ The username.
&& 						→ Only if the previous command succeeds, run the next part.
echo "Devops_Guy:YourPasswordHere" | sudo chpasswd → Set the password for Devops_Guy.
Important: Replace YourPasswordHere with a strong password.
