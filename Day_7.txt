SSH authentication on Linux refers to the methods used to verify the identity of a user or system when connecting via SSH (Secure Shell).
SSH is a protocol used to securely access remote machines, run commands, and transfer files.


What SSH Authentication Is ?

When you connect to a Linux server using SSH, the server needs to confirm who you are. This verification process is SSH authentication.
SSH provides secure, encrypted communication and supports multiple authentication methods.

"Common SSH Authentication Methods "
1. 	Password Authentication
	You log in by typing a username and password.
	Simple but less secure.
	Can be disabled for improved security.

2.	Public Key Authentication (most common & recommended)
	You generate a key pair:
	Private key → kept on your local machine.
	Public key  → stored on the server in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.
    During login:
	The server checks if your private key matches the public key.
	More secure and convenient (can use passphrases or agents like ssh-agent).

3. 	Host-Based Authentication
	Machines authenticate each other instead of individual users.
	Used mostly in trusted internal networks.

4. 	Keyboard-Interactive Authentication
	Prompts for multiple forms of verification.
	Often used with 2FA/MFA.
	
5. 	GSSAPI / Kerberos Authentication
	Enterprise authentication using centralized systems (like Active Directory or Kerberos).
	
Where SSH Auth is Configured ?
Configuration file: /etc/ssh/sshd_config  (path )


Why SSH Authentication Matters ?

	Protects against unauthorized access.
	Prevents password guessing/bruteforce attacks when using keys.
	Enables automation (scripts, deployments) securely.
	
	
Task Description :  Linux SSH Authentication - Settingup a passwordless authentication login
	
STEP 1:	Make an SSH key for thor (one-time only)
		Command:ssh-keygen

What it means:

Creates a “magic login key” for thor.
Just press ENTER 3–4 times.

It creates two files:
id_rsa → secret key (keep safe)
id_rsa.pub → public key (share with servers)

STEP 2:	Send thor’s public key to tony on stapp01
		Command:ssh-copy-id tony@stapp01

What it means:
Connect to stapp01 as user tony
Copy thor’s public key into tony’s authorized_keys
This makes password-less login work

You will enter tony’s password one last time: Prompt password



STEP 3:	Test the password-less login
		Command:ssh tony@stapp01

What it means:
Try to log in to stapp01 as tony
If the key was installed, no password will be asked
