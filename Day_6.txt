What is a cron job in Linux?

A cron job is a scheduled task in Linux that runs automatically at specified intervals.
Cron is managed by the cron daemon (crond), which constantly checks the schedule defined in cron configuration files (crontabs) 
and runs commands or scripts at the correct time.

Use case:

Used for automation (backups, cleanup tasks, monitoring, scripts).
Schedules are defined in a file called crontab.
Each user (including root) can have their own crontab.
Runs in the background via the crond service.


Crontab time format:

*  *  *  *  *
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  └── Day of week (0–7)
|  |  |  └──── Month (1–12)
|  |  └─────── Day of month (1–31)
|  └────────── Hour (0–23)
└───────────── Minute (0–59)
